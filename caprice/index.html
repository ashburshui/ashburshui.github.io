                    <blockquote>
                        <p><em>"As I began to love myself I found that anguish and emotional suffering are only warning
                            signs that I was living against my own truth. Today, I know, this is "AUTHENTICITY".</em>
                        </p>
                        <p><em>As I began to love myself I understood how much it can offend somebody if I try to force
                            my
                            desires on this person, even though I knew the time was not right and the person was not
                            ready for it, and even though this person was me. Today I call it "RESPECT".</em></p>
                        <p><em>As I began to love myself I stopped craving for a different life, and I could see that
                            everything that surrounded me was inviting me to grow. Today I call it "MATURITY".</em></p>
                        <p><em>As I began to love myself I understood that at any circumstance, I am in the right place
                            at
                            the right time, and everything happens at the exactly right moment. So I could be calm.
                            Today I call it "SELF-CONFIDENCE".</em></p>
                        <p><em>As I began to love myself I quit stealing my own time, and I stopped designing huge
                            projects
                            for the future. Today, I only do what brings me joy and happiness, things I love to do and
                            that make my heart cheer, and I do them in my own way and in my own rhythm. Today I call it
                            "SIMPLICITY".</em></p>
                        <p><em>As I began to love myself I freed myself of anything that is no good for my health –
                            food,
                            people, things, situations, and everything that drew me down and away from myself. At first
                            I called this attitude a healthy egoism. Today I know it is "LOVE OF ONESELF".</em></p>
                        <p><em>As I began to love myself I quit trying to always be right, and ever since I was wrong
                            less
                            of the time. Today I discovered that is "MODESTY".</em></p>
                        <p><em>As I began to love myself I refused to go on living in the past and worrying about the
                            future. Now, I only live for the moment, where everything is happening. Today I live each
                            day, day by day, and I call it "FULFILLMENT".</em></p>
                        <p><em>As I began to love myself I recognized that my mind can disturb me and it can make me
                            sick.
                            But as I connected it to my heart, my mind became a valuable ally. Today I call this
                            connection "WISDOM OF THE HEART".</em></p>
                        <p><em>We no longer need to fear arguments, confrontations or any kind of problems with
                            ourselves or
                            others. Even stars collide, and out of their crashing new worlds are born. Today I know
                            "THAT IS LIFE"!"</em></p>
